# Project Description
In this project, we implemented the models from paper: DenseNet Models for Tiny ImageNet Classification by Zoheb Abai and Nishad Rajmalwar. They designed two models to perform image classification on Tiny ImageNet dataset which contained 200 different categories of objects. When the authors were building their models, they restricted themselves to avoid using dense layers and only use Google Colab to run their codes. This resulted in limited GPU and runtime availability. To simulate their work, we implemented our models in Google Colab as well. The runtime restriction in Google Colab is about 10 hours. Therefore, we divided our training process to several sessions and saved models very often. All saved models and data used to plot were in Google Drive shared with TA.
